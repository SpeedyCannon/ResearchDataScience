Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System surveys ask degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, unable to do—individual has in seeing (with glasses or contact lenses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Respondents who answered ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" or ""unable to do"" for any activity were classified as having a disability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SOURCE: National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT): 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data from survey cycle 2013, as of 24 February 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
