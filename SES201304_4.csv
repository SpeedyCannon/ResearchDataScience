Standard errors for numbers are rounded up to the nearest 500. Detail may not add to total because of rounding and because person may report more than one disability. Scientists and engineers are bachelor's and higher degreed individuals living in the United States with an S&E or S&E-related degree or occupation. See appendix for additional details on coverage, eligibility, educational field classification, and occupational classification. Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System surveys ask degree of difficulty—none, slight, moderate, severe, unable to do—individual has in seeing (with glasses or contact lenses), hearing (with hearing aid), walking without assistance, lifting 10 pounds, or concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. Respondents who answered ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" or ""unable to do"" for any activity were classified as having a disability. The doctorate estimates are from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), which represents the total U.S. college educated population. This is in contrast to the doctorate estimates from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, which represent the population of U.S. doctorate degree recipients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SOURCE: National Science Foundation, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT): 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data from survey cycle 2013, as of 24 February 2015.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
